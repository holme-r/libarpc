If building from the revision control system automake/autoconf infrastructure must be setup, run these commands:

aclocal
libtoolize --automake -c 
autoconf
autoheader
automake -ac

At this point, the tree is roughly in it's src distribution state.

Run:

./configure CFLAGS=-Wall to setup to build for the local platform.

Then 

make

make install

(or whatever)
